\section{Introduction}
ZebroBus is the standard for communication between different modules of Zebro.
It was designed with modularity in mind, and is intended to be suitable for use with \emph{any} kind of Zebro module.
When designing new modules, the designers are strongly encouraged to implement ZebroBus according to this specification.
If --- for whatever reason --- this would not possible, the designers should update ZebroBus to suit their needs.
However, this updated version of ZebroBus should be backwards compatible with all previous versions.
This document does not specify the voltage levels ZebroBus should function on.
