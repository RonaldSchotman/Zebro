Read me of the Pico Zebro Demo

The more I will learn about read me and git the better this map and readme will look

This map is the Pico Zebro map.

In this map there are multiple sub maps that you can pay attention to.
First of is the Measurments for the FOV of the camera with two different resolutions

All the test pictures will be saved in Pico_Pict. In here the code saves the picture 
before determing if there is a Pico Zebro in the demo.
The latest version of the code is in PZDemo_OpenCV
the version before that is in PZDemo_orient3.
All the funcions that are used in this code can be seen in the map functions.
With a extra file named Temp_Save_code where random code will be saved during testing of
a part of the program.

Next to that before there was git the version manager was through making a new one code
from scratch so that is why there is a map Old Code. 

Finally there is a map Bluetooth where the test codes for bluetooth codes will be
and a map Calibration where the test map is for calibration of the camera.
Both dont work yet.
